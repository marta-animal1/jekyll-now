Have you ever gone to a zoo or your just exploring someplace and you see some animal that's pretty far away and you have that thought aw man I wish I had some binoculars? Yeah same here I hate those moments when you see something really cool and you can't see it. Well you should go purchase some binoculars. Binoculars will be able to help you see from far away and close up also. Binocular vision also allows for stereopsis, or the ability to view the world in three dimensions. Prey animals tend to have monocular vision.
